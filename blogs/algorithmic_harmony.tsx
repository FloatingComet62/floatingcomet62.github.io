People say that it would be the worst nightmare and an existential threat that an algorithm will run the world.<br />
But it might be the complete opposite. Because an algorithm doesn't have greed to earn more money.<br />
The current world is ran by people who have a shit ton of money, and most of them want more of it like some sort of <Bold>wealth slut</Bold>.<br />
But if we have an algorithm in place of it, which we design to maximize some sort of human lifestyle index,<br />
then it would make lives of most of the people <Bold>way better</Bold>.<br />
<br />
But how will it maximize that?<br />
<br />
Probably running simulations with different decisions??<br />
<br />
Something like that, idk<br />
